Mechanics: Programmer should be able to simulate whatever they want. That is, as long as 
            input is syntactically correct, we have a corresponding output. 
            Int variables are milk plants
            String variables are catgirls. 
            
            If either is used without being fed, they die. 

            Int lifespan is based on lines traversed since creation.
            String variables are based on how many you used.
            (Feed a table to the interpreter containing all the variable names.)

            Oh if you don't want lifespans, use rock(basically, golems). You can set it as default. 
            rock int tree.
            rock string miao;

            We got if, pointers, while, 

            pointers are books. (immortal btw)
            echoing a pointer generates: I'm a book about a shrub/cat;
            








Gameplay:   Programmer should code, simulate, and repeat. Interesting stories happen at each execution. I'm
            unsure on whether or not I should add the story. For now, we have the bare simulation. As all 
            simulations, players are like god, distant from the world, until they realize the consequences of 
            their actions. 

Experience: Player should feel like they have ultimate control at first, but later feel less powerful knowing they
            are not the supreme ruler of the universe. 

            Player must trade control for power.
